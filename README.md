# Safe at School

Safe at School is a web-based interactive gamethat aims to teach elementary school students how to follow public health guidelines for COVID-19 at school. Users are greeted with a personalized welcome screen after entering their name, and are then led through a series of realistic situations that may occur in a regular school day. This game was made for the IgnitionHacks hackathon, Division Delta.
